# area-filling-
This program implements an area filling which makes use of stack data structure. Area filling is the process of filling a connected and closed area in a map with a given value (color or a filling character). The map is a 2D array with solid boundary and some occupied cells within itself. A connected and closed area in this map contains consecutive empty cells surrounded by the boundary and/or occupied cells. Such an area can be of any shape (including amorphous shapes). In the program, the user will enter a coordinate of an empty cell of an area in the map. After that, the program should fill all the empty cells in the corresponding area with a filling character.
